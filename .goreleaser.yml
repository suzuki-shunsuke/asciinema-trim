  # Setting this will prevent goreleaser to actually try to commit the updated
  # formula - instead, the formula file will be stored on the dist folder only,
  # leaving the responsibility of publishing it to the user.
  # If set to auto, the release will not be uploaded to the homebrew tap
  # in case there is an indicator for prerelease in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
  # Default is false.
